Internet of Things Project

Rise is an experimental wearable project that aims to explore ways of communication and data visualization through Internet connected garments.

In a first essay, we developed a web application that, through an open source API, sends information about the weather of a given city to a garment embedded with an Internet of Things hardware development board. The piece of clothing then produces light stimuli based on the data received.
